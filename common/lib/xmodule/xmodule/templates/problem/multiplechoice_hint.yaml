       Targeted feedback for multiple-choice questions is an opportunity to address common student misconceptions in the distractors, or incorrect answer choices. The feedback for the incorrect answers can be written to target the misconceptions that are appropriate for the level of the student (e.g., elementary, middle, high school, college) and should be based on the common mistakes students make. Also, feedback should provide some guidance to the student about how to arrive at the correct answer. 

       In addition, feedback for the correct answer is an opportunity to reinforce why the answer is correct rather than simply state "Correct." Since students are able to guess, feedback should provide a reason why that selection is correct for students who may have selected that answer by chance.

       The feedback is provided immediately below the question after the student clicks the "Check" button.  Hints can also be available for students to request when they are struggling.
